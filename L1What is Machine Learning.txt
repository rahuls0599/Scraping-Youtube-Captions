The definition of machine learning down to just five words-- using data to answer questions. We can split the definition into two parts-- using
data and answer questions. Using data is what we refer to as training, while answering questions is referred to as making predictions. Training
refers to using our data to inform the creation and fine tuning of a predictive model. This predictive model can then be used to serve up 
predictions on previously unseen data and answer those questions. As more data is gathered, the model can be improved over time and new 
predictive models deployed.
